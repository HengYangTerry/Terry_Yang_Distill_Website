```

We have learnt a lot about creating data visualizations with R in class. Here are three data visualizations that I liked most from MATH 230.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

data1 = data.frame(old = c(19, 24, 20, 24, 20, 28, 30, 27, 38, 35, 
                          36, 39, 43, 48, 49, 51, 55, 62, 65, 55, 77),
                  young = c(30, 27, 39, 40, 47, 44, 49, 63, 51, 66, 62, 
                            61, 56, 50, 44, 65, 64, 61, 64, 70, 81),
                  row.names = c("Brazil", "Mali", "Peru", "France", "Argentina", 
                                "Cameroon", "Spain", "Japan", "U.K.", "U.S.", 
                                "Ukraine", "Germany", "Lebanon", "Bangladesh", 
                                "Morocco", "Kenya", "Ethiopia", "Nigeria", 
                                "India", "Zimbabwe", "Indonesia"))

ggplot(data = data1, aes(x = old, y = young, label = rownames(data1))) +
  geom_point(size = 4, color = "#70AB9F") + 
  geom_abline(linewidth = 1.5) + 
  geom_text(hjust=0, vjust=-1) + 
  xlim(12.5, 87.5) + 
  ylim(12.5, 87.5) + 
  labs(x = "", y = "")
```

$\mathcal{People}$ $in$ $\mathcal{Countries}$

First, we have a data visualization about the percentage of old and young people in 21 different countries. We made a scatterplot using the data. And with a diagnal line in the plot, we can clearly see that most countries have more young people than old people, and a few countries has more old people than young people. This the first visualization I tried to replicate in this course, even though there are some difference from the example image, I believe that this visualization has a very deep meaning for me.

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
library(Lock5Data)
data("BikeCommute")
ggplot(BikeCommute, aes(x = TopSpeed, y = AvgSpeed)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_solarized() + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "linen"))
```

$\mathcal{Bike}$ $\mathcal{Top}$ $\mathcal{Speed}$ $vs$ $\mathcal{Average}$ $\mathcal{Speed}$

This is the visualization using the build-in data in the package "Lock5Data", called "BikeCommute". This is by far the visualization that I like the most. I used the data of top speed and average speed of each bike to make this scattorplot, and using the themes in r, made this visualization having a feel of "Go Board", which is an entertainment that I enjoy in my free time.

```{r}
library("ggside")
library("carData")
data("OBrienKaiser")
OBrienKaiser = OBrienKaiser[complete.cases(OBrienKaiser), ]
ggplot(OBrienKaiser, aes(x = pre.2, y = post.2, fill = treatment)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = treatment)) +
  geom_xsidedensity(alpha = .3, position = "stack") +
  geom_ysideboxplot(aes(x = treatment), orientation = "x") +
  scale_ysidex_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45))
```

$\mathcal{Cars}$

Lastly, this is a data visualization using the data set in the package "carData", called "OBrienKaiser". I made a scatterplot along with a bar plot and a density plot using the data. And in the plot, we can clearly see that most countries how does the observations varies in the pre.2 and post.2 with treatments. This the visualization I have while trying to understand a new ggplot extensino code called "ggside", even though I don't really understand the meaning of the data and observation in this data set, I believe that this visualization means a lot for me.
