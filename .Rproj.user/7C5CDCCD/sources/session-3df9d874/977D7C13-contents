Before the game starts, two teams will go through the Pick/Ban phase, banning a total of 10 champions out of 163, and choosing a total of 10 champions out of the others. This phase begins with blue team banning the first champion, and red team banning another champion. Then two teams will repeat this process until each teams has chosen 3 champions to ban. After this first round of banning, the first round of choosing champions begins. Blue team will start with choosing 1 champion for their team and red team will choose 2 champions for their team. Then blue team will choose 2 champions for their team and red team will chose 1. As for now, each team has already chosen 3 champions to ban and 3 champion to use. Now, round 2 of banning begins. In this round, red team will ban 1 champion first, and blue team ban 1 champion after this. And two teams will repeat this process until each teams has chosen 2 champions to ban. Then red team starts choosing 1 champion to use, and blue team chooses 2 champions to use after red team finishes choosing. And finally, the red team chooses 1 last champion to use. (By the way, there are no repeating champions in these 20 spots. And the length of time allowed for each pick or ban is 30 seconds.) Therefore, the game starts.

The Pick/Ban phase is one of the biggest and hardest phase of the game. Even though each team will have their coach with them during this phase, there might be some bad choices during this phase, which will lead to a hard time in the rest of the game, or even loss.

Since each champion has their own strength in the game, some of the champions are over powered, some champions counter some other champions, and some champions can linkage with some other champions, these are some factors that makes this phase harder than expected.

Here we start with some plots of data from Pick/Ban phase.

Firstly, we have a histogram of champion picks. We can see that there are far more champions, which get picked less, than the champions that are picked more. We can clearly see from this graph, the number of champions picked for less than 1000 games are a lot greater than the number of champions picked for more than 1000 games.

```{r}
plot1 = ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = LOLesportS12$Picks, y = ..density..), bins = 30, fill = "peachpuff", alpha = 0.75) + 
  geom_density(aes(x = LOLesportS12$Picks), col = "blue") +
  xlab("Champions") +
  ggtitle("Champion Picks") + 
  theme_classic()

plot2 = ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = LOLesportS12$Bans, y = ..density..), bins = 30, fill = "peachpuff", alpha = 0.75) + 
  geom_density(aes(x = LOLesportS12$Bans), col = "blue") +
  xlab("Champions") +
  ggtitle("Champion Bans") + 
  theme_classic()

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2)
```

Now similarly, we have a histogram of champion bans. We can see that there are far more champions, which get banned less, than the champions that are banned more. We can clearly see from this graph, the number of champions banned for less than 1500 games are a lot greater than the number of champions banned for more than 1500 games.

This means that there are only a few champions that are over powered in this game, and there are about half of the champions having a low rank. And all teams would tend to pick or ban these over powered champions first rather than giving the enemy team the chance to choose them.

```{r}
plot_1 = ggplot(LOLesportS12, aes(x = Picks, y = Bans, image = img, label = Champion)) +
  geom_image() + 
  geom_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust=-1, size =2, color = "red") + 
  geom_abline(color = "blue") + 
  xlim(-10, 3000) + 
  ylim(-10, 3500) + 
  labs(x = "Picks", y = "Bans", title = "Champion Picks vs. Bans")

temp3 = LOLesportS12[LOLesportS12$Picks >= 1000 & LOLesportS12$Picks < LOLesportS12$Bans,]

plot_2 = ggplot(data = temp3, aes(x = Picks, y = Bans, label = Champion, image = img)) +
  geom_image() + 
  geom_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust=-1, size =2, color = "red") +
  ylim(1200, 3500) + 
  labs(x = "Picks", y = "Bans", title = "Most Necessary Bans")

temp = LOLesportS12[LOLesportS12$Avg_BT != 0,]

plot_3 = ggplot(data = temp, aes(x = Bans, y = Avg_BT, image = img, label = Champion)) +
  geom_image() + 
  geom_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust=-1, size =2, color = "red") +
  ylim(2, 10) + 
  labs(x = "Bans", y = "Average Ban Turn", title = "Necessary Bans")

temp2 = LOLesportS12[LOLesportS12$Picks <= 50,]

plot_4 = ggplot(data = temp2, aes(x = Picks, y = Winrate, image = img, label = Champion)) +
  geom_image() + 
  geom_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust=-0.5, size =2, color = "red") +
  ylim(0, 105) + 
  labs(x = "Picks", y = "Winrates", title = "Low Rank Champions")

grid.arrange(plot_1, plot_2, plot_3, plot_4, ncol = 2)
```

In the visualization on the top left corner, we are comparing the number of picks and bans for each champions. On first glance, we can see that there are a huge number of low ranked champions clustered with properties that being picked for less than 500 games and being banned for less than 500 games. And at the other side of the graph, there are champions that are tier 0 or 1 (high ranked), or over powered. And for some champions like Zeri and Gwen, they had been banned even more than being picked, meaning that they are far too over powered, teams would rather not using these champions themselves than letting the other team having the chance to use them. Also, there are some champions like Aphelios, Nautilus, Jinx, Viego, Gnar and Leona, being picked more than being banned, this means that these champions has a very high rank and tier, and is useful and but not that necessary to be banned in the game. Also, for those champions, we can see in the plot of the bottom left that they have average ban turns less than 6, which means that those high ranked or over powered champions are usually banned in the first round of banning phase.

And for the visualization on the top right corner, the observation in the plot are the champion that have times being banned higher than times being picks. Those are the most necessary bans for the champions, including Zeri, Gwen, two over powered champions and Corki, Sylas, Ryze, Azir, Ranata Glasc, five most useful champion on the team. If these champions are present in a game, the victory balance is tilted to the team playing these champions.

Since there are some high ranked champions, there are also some low ranked champions. In the plot on the bottom right corner, the observations in the plot are the low ranked champions in the Pro League. These champions are not usually used in Pro League games, they have pick times less or equal to 50, and as a result, they might have some insane win rate, for instance, Warwick was only picked for once in Pro League and therefore have a 100% win rate. The reason of not picking these champion is that they do not have a very powerful data or they are not that useful to the team.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = LOLesportS12$Winrate, y = ..density..), bins = 30, fill = "peachpuff", alpha = 0.75) + 
  geom_density(aes(x = LOLesportS12$Winrate), col = "blue") +
  xlab("Win Rates") +
  ggtitle("Champion Win Rates") + 
  theme_classic()
```

Here is the plot for win rates of all champions, generally, most champions have a win rate about 50%, expect for some outliers that only being present in few games, so if we only look at one champion, we can not decide whether the team is going to win. But League of Legend is a team based game, we must see the whole team's line-up to see how the victory balance change.
