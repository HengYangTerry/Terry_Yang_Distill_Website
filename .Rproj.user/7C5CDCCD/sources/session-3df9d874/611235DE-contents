As a student of MATH 230, learning about R-studio. This website includes some beautiful visualization from the course, for instance, art works using mathematics equations, Bucknell University theme, interesting plot I tried to duplicate, other plots I learnt through Google, and a interactive visualization talking about confidence intervals/levels, which is a topic in statistic. Statistical computing is an essential component of statistics and data literacy. During this course, I have learnt about both simulation and data visualization through the lens of statistical computing using the advanced statistical software language R. I have become efficient and proficient coders in the statistical language R and deepen my understanding of introductory statistics topics through simulation based learning and nonparametric methods.
