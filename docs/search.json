      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the highest ranked or over powered champions in the game. We will be working on some reason about why these champions are high ranked or over powered. However, we are not focusing on the two support champions, Nautilus and Leona, they are high ranked in pick/ban phase because they are very useful in a team’s line-up, but not because they have a strong champion status. And from the next radar chart, we can see that they do not have a high data with each corner.\n\n\n\nThis interactive visualization has more specific data for these champions, including champion names, win rate, kill death average, creep score per minute, gold per minute, and damage to enemy champions per minute.\nIn this radar chart, we have five data for each champion, win rate, kill death average, creep score per minute, gold per minute, and damage to enemy champions per minute. In this game, gamers gain creep score through killing minions in any lane, top, middle, or bottom, or killing neutral monsters in the jungle areas. Having high creep score means having more gold and more experience(XP), which will lead to having better items and having higher levels. we will talk about the relationship between creep score, gold, and experience at the very last part.\n\n\n\nBetween all these radar charts, we can see that all these champions have win rates at about 50%, since they are played more than 1500 games, their win rates get closer and closer to 50%, like repeated sampling in statistics, when we have more and more samplings, the graph gets closer and closer to normal distributed.\nAnd we can see from these charts, champions like Zeri, Gwen, Jinx, Aphelios and Ahri, they have CSM (creep score per minute) and GPM (gold per minute) near to the maximum of all champions, this means that these champions are good at clearing lanes and gaining gold. This is the first big measurement to determine whether a champion is high ranked or over powered.\nSecondly, we can see that champions like Zeri, Gwen, Jinx, Ahri, Aphelios, and Gnar, they have a DPM (damage to enemy champions per minute) near to the maximum of all champions, this means that these champions are good at causing damage and even kill more enemy champions, when they are present in the game, for most games, they are the center damage position in the team.\nAlso, we can see that Zeri, Jinx and Ahri have the highest KDA (kill death average) among these champions, and since almost all these 15 champions are good at killing enemy champions, this means that they are good at escaping a fight that is not good or advantageous for them and therefore saving their lives from death.\nLast but not least, for jungle champions like Viego, Lee Sin, Wukong and Xin Zhao, even though they do not have a high CSM (creep score per minute), they still have a pretty high GPM (gold per minute), as they are catching lanes and finding opertunity to fight through out the game.\n\n\n\nNow, we look at the CSM (creep score per minute), CSD (creep score difference at 15 minutes), KDA (kill death average), GPM (gold per minute), GD (gold difference at 15 minute) and DPM (damage to enemy champion per minute). First, we compare the graphs of CSM and GPM, we can see that the density plot are similar with these two graphs, so we can say that there is a huge connection between creep score and gold. Second, if we look at the graphs of CSD and GD at the same time, we can see that most champions do not have a big creep score difference and gold difference, therefore we can say that champion strength is only a fragment of reasons to make a team’s advantages greater, other reasons including player’s ability and proficiency, decision making and game strategy. Lastly, if we look at the last two graphs, KDA and DPM, we can see that most champions have less data than the high ranked or over powered champions.\n\n\n\nIn the very last part, we have some more graphs about the relationship creep score, gold and experience. From these two graphs, we can clearly see that there is a strong relationship between creep score and gold/experience, since creep score, killing minions or monsters is the most efficient and useful way to gain gold and experience.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nStatistical Inference is the process of drawing conclusions about the population based only on information in the sample. We want to choose the statistic that is the best estimator of the parameter as our estimator. Statistics are random variables and we refer to their distributions as sampling distributions.A sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic calculated from all possible samples of the same size from the population. It shows us how the sample statistic varies from sample to sample.The sampling distribution of a statistic is characterized by a certain shape, mean, and standard error. Because an estimate is a single number, and by itself it does not provide information about the precision and reliability of the estimate. An alternative to reporting a single value for the parameter being estimated, is to report an interval estimate that provides a plausible range of values for the population parameter. This range of values should account for the precision and reliability of the single point estimate based on the distribution from which it came. A confidence interval for a parameter is an interval computed from a random sample of data by a method that will capture the true parameter for a specified proportion of all samples, and the success rate is the proportion of all samples whose calculated intervals contain the parameter, known as the confidence level. So after calculating the confidence interval, we usually say that “we are 95% (confidence level) sure that this interval contains the true mean”. Now we have a visualization to play with and think about how this works.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nDuring the class of MATH230, we learnt about using R to make some generated art works. Here are three art works generated in r using codes. We used the package called “aRtsy”. And I used the codes including “canvas_maze”, “canvas_circlemap” and “canvas_function” to make these images.\nLEATHAL MAZEThere is an old saying by Nietzsche, “When you look long into an abyss, the abyss looks into you”. I created this image when I was thinking about this. If you try to look at the center of the maze, you can feel that the world is twisting and rotating. And when I do this, I feel some deep fear from the heart.\nBUCKNELL IN FOGI tried to create a image based on Bucknell theme. The first thought was the symbol of our university, and I tried to fit the colors and the “B” into it. I used the colors “blue”, “orange”, #0047AB” and “#FF8400”, which best represents the colors for Bucknell. And in the end, I get this art work. If you look closer at this image, there is a huge “B” in this fog. And since we have capricious weather in Lewisburg, I believe foggy image fits the Bucknell theme.\nDANCING CURVEI generated this last art work using two mathematics equations, \\(x_i^2 - sin(y_i^2)\\) and \\(cos(x_i^2) - log(y_i^2)\\), and with the twist of code in R, I have this dancing curves which is very stretched lines. This is the art work that really made I feel like an artist.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nWe have learnt a lot about creating data visualizations with R in class. Here are three data visualizations that I liked most from MATH 230.\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{People}\\) \\(in\\) \\(\\mathcal{Countries}\\)\nFirst, we have a data visualization about the percentage of old and young people in 21 different countries. We made a scatterplot using the data. And with a diagnal line in the plot, we can clearly see that most countries have more young people than old people, and a few countries has more old people than young people. This the first visualization I tried to replicate in this course, even though there are some difference from the example image, I believe that this visualization has a very deep meaning for me.\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{Bike}\\) \\(\\mathcal{Top}\\) \\(\\mathcal{Speed}\\) \\(vs\\) \\(\\mathcal{Average}\\) \\(\\mathcal{Speed}\\)\nThis is the visualization using the build-in data in the package “Lock5Data”, called “BikeCommute”. This is by far the visualization that I like the most. I used the data of top speed and average speed of each bike to make this scattorplot, and using the themes in r, made this visualization having a feel of “Go Board”, which is an entertainment that I enjoy in my free time.\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{Cars}\\)\nLastly, this is a data visualization using the data set in the package “carData”, called “OBrienKaiser”. I made a scatterplot along with a bar plot and a density plot using the data. And in the plot, we can clearly see that most countries how does the observations varies in the pre.2 and post.2 with treatments. This the visualization I have while trying to understand a new ggplot extensino code called “ggside”, even though I don’t really understand the meaning of the data and observation in this data set, I believe that this visualization means a lot for me.\n\n\n\n",

This website includes some beautiful visualization from the course, for instance, art works using mathematics equations, Bucknell University theme, interesting plot I tried to duplicate, other plots I learnt through Google, and a interactive visualization talking about confidence intervals/levels, which is a topic in statistic. Statistical computing is an essential component of statistics and data literacy. During this course, I have learnt about both simulation and data visualization through the lens of statistical computing using the advanced statistical software language R. I have become efficient and proficient coders in the statistical language R and deepen my understanding of introductory statistics topics through simulation based learning and nonparametric methods.

      "contents": "\nLeague of Legends is a game published by Riot Games in 2009. This is one of the biggest team-based game with 163 champions to play with. Each champion has its own category and role in the game, categories including assassins, fighters, mages, marksmen, supports and tanks, and roles including top, jungle, middle, bottom and supports, where one’s category is fixed and role is not. In each game, consist of 10 players, divided into two teams of 5 players, blue team and red team, each player has a role in the team, either top, jungle, middle, bottom or support.\nIn a game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a “champion”, with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League’s main mode, Summoner’s Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their “Nexus”, a large structure located within.\nThis is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. As of now, season 13 of this game, there are total of 163 champions available to play. Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by accruing experience points (XP) through killing enemies. Items can be acquired to increase champions’ strength, and are bought with gold, which players accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the opposing team’s minions, champions, or defensive structures. In League of Legend Pro League, Summoner’s Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu available to players only when their champion is in the team’s base. Each game is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one game to another.\nLeague of Legends Game MapIn this website, I am working with the League of Legends Pro League data from Season 12, which is last season, to find out the champions’ strength, and priority last year.\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\n\n\n\nBefore the game starts, two teams will go through the Pick/Ban phase, banning a total of 10 champions out of 163, and choosing a total of 10 champions out of the others. This phase begins with blue team banning the first champion, and red team banning another champion. Then two teams will repeat this process until each teams has chosen 3 champions to ban. After this first round of banning, the first round of choosing champions begins. Blue team will start with choosing 1 champion for their team and red team will choose 2 champions for their team. Then blue team will choose 2 champions for their team and red team will chose 1. As for now, each team has already chosen 3 champions to ban and 3 champion to use. Now, round 2 of banning begins. In this round, red team will ban 1 champion first, and blue team ban 1 champion after this. And two teams will repeat this process until each teams has chosen 2 champions to ban. Then red team starts choosing 1 champion to use, and blue team chooses 2 champions to use after red team finishes choosing. And finally, the red team chooses 1 last champion to use. (By the way, there are no repeating champions in these 20 spots. And the length of time allowed for each pick or ban is 30 seconds.) Therefore, the game starts.\nThe Pick/Ban phase is one of the biggest and hardest phase of the game. Even though each team will have their coach with them during this phase, there might be some bad choices during this phase, which will lead to a hard time in the rest of the game, or even loss.\nSince each champion has their own strength in the game, some of the champions are over powered, some champions counter some other champions, and some champions can linkage with some other champions, these are some factors that makes this phase harder than expected.\nHere we start with some plots of data from Pick/Ban phase.\nFirstly, we have a histogram of champion picks. We can see that there are far more champions, which get picked less, than the champions that are picked more. We can clearly see from this graph, the number of champions picked for less than 1000 games are a lot greater than the number of champions picked for more than 1000 games.\n\n\n\nNow similarly, we have a histogram of champion bans. We can see that there are far more champions, which get banned less, than the champions that are banned more. We can clearly see from this graph, the number of champions banned for less than 1500 games are a lot greater than the number of champions banned for more than 1500 games.\nThis means that there are only a few champions that are over powered in this game, and there are about half of the champions having a low rank. And all teams would tend to pick or ban these over powered champions first rather than giving the enemy team the chance to choose them.\n\n\n\nIn the visualization on the top left corner, we are comparing the number of picks and bans for each champions. On first glance, we can see that there are a huge number of low ranked champions clustered with properties that being picked for less than 500 games and being banned for less than 500 games. And at the other side of the graph, there are champions that are tier 0 or 1 (high ranked), or over powered. And for some champions like Zeri and Gwen, they had been banned even more than being picked, meaning that they are far too over powered, teams would rather not using these champions themselves than letting the other team having the chance to use them. Also, there are some champions like Aphelios, Nautilus, Jinx, Viego, Gnar and Leona, being picked more than being banned, this means that these champions has a very high rank and tier, and is useful and but not that necessary to be banned in the game. Also, for those champions, we can see in the plot of the bottom left that they have average ban turns less than 6, which means that those high ranked or over powered champions are usually banned in the first round of banning phase.\nAnd for the visualization on the top right corner, the observation in the plot are the champion that have times being banned higher than times being picks. Those are the most necessary bans for the champions, including Zeri, Gwen, two over powered champions and Corki, Sylas, Ryze, Azir, Ranata Glasc, five most useful champion on the team. If these champions are present in a game, the victory balance is tilted to the team playing these champions.\nSince there are some high ranked champions, there are also some low ranked champions. In the plot on the bottom right corner, the observations in the plot are the low ranked champions in the Pro League. These champions are not usually used in Pro League games, they have pick times less or equal to 50, and as a result, they might have some insane win rate, for instance, Warwick was only picked for once in Pro League and therefore have a 100% win rate. The reason of not picking these champion is that they do not have a very powerful data or they are not that useful to the team.\n\n\n\nHere is the plot for win rates of all champions, generally, most champions have a win rate about 50%, expect for some outliers that only being present in few games, so if we only look at one champion, we can not decide whether the team is going to win. But League of Legend is a team based game, we must see the whole team’s line-up to see how the victory balance change.\n\n\n\n",
